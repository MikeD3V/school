<h1>A Short Autobiography</h1>


<div class="details">
<p>Iâ€™m Mike Louie Eman, an 18-year-old senior high school student with a passion for web design and development. From a young age, I was fascinated by technology, which led me to explore front-end programming. I enjoy creating visually appealing and functional websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to continuously improve my skills and stay updated with the latest trends in web development.</p>

<p>Aside from coding, I have also started a small homemade food business in my local area. I enjoy making and selling snacks, which allows me to combine my creativity with entrepreneurship. Running this business has taught me valuable lessons about time management, customer service, and financial responsibility. It also gives me a sense of fulfillment, knowing that people enjoy the food I make.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I aspire to further develop my expertise in web development and expand my business. I want to take on more projects that challenge my skills and push me to grow as a developer. At the same time, I hope to refine my business strategies and explore new opportunities to reach more customers. With dedication and continuous learning, I am excited about what the future holds.</p>
