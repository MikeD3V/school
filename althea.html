    <h1>ALL ABOUT MYSELF</h1>

    <p>My name is Althea Alvarado, a 17-year-old Senior High School student at Don Bosco in Cebu, currently taking the ICT programming track. I have always been passionate about creativity and self-expression, which led me to the world of cosplay. Designing and making my own costumes, along with doing hair and makeup, has allowed me to showcase my artistic side.</p>

    <p>Apart from my studies, I have ventured into small businesses, including a mini eatery and a dessert business. My love for arts and crafts inspired me to create satin flower arrangements, which helped me develop essential skills in managing and growing a business. Balancing school, business, and personal life has taught me the importance of hard work and determination.</p>

    <p>As I continue my journey, I'm excited to keep learning and growing in ICT while also pushing my creative boundaries. I'm determined to keep working hard, following my passions, and building a future that I can be proud of. This is just the beginning of my story, and I can't wait to see where life takes me next.</p>
